## Project Description

**Exploring the role of media in economic effects of epidemics**

The project seeks to understand the role that newspapers may have played (and are playing) in the economic effects of the epidemics: 

- Is there a correlation between the epidemic/crisis coverage and the state of the economy and business activity? 
- How important is sentiment for predicting business failure/ recovery?  

Two queries are proposed: 
-	Searches based on years and taxonomy terms relating to epidemics 
-	Searches based on years and taxonomy for economic consequences (*not covered during the project*)

Results will be compared to be if there are any correlations of results.

**Frequency results** using eight different lexicons can be visualized [here](https://github.com/defoe-code/defoe_visualization/tree/master/Round_1/Galina_Andreeva).
