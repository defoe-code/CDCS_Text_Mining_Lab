## Project Description

**What counts as culture? Reporting and criticism in The Times 1785-2000**


How have arts and culture been reported? what counts as quality? how have cultural hierarchies changed over time. There has been some work looking at this from a cross European perspective, working from the 1980s-2010s, but nothing with the scope and reach of this sort of archive. 

The project will need to run queries to filter first the articles/text regarding with Music (that will be the target word)
and then run a sentiment analysis with those. 

**Frequency results** can be visualized [here](https://github.com/defoe-code/defoe_visualization/tree/master/Round_1/Dave_OBrien)
