## Project description

This project looks to answer two question:

- whether there is increased reporting accuracy of mental illness symptoms against the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) over time

- whether there is a shift in the themes of explicit bias to implicit bias towards psychological disorders.

The project is interested in the sources between 1975 to 2020 – only Times Digital Archive covers part of this (until 2009). 

Question: **Which are the terms/lexicon that will be used for detecting if an article is reporting about mental illness symptoms?**  

With the subset of articles found (that talks about DSM), the project could create a new defoe query for counting how many **explicit** and **implicit** bias terms are found per article, so then an article could be classified as explicit or implicit bias.  Therefore, two lexicons will be also needed here – one for explicit bias terms  and other form implicit bias terms.  

The project will benefit as well from creating a new sentiment analyses query to study explicit and implicit bias categories.  These tasks will be challenging, and new queries in defoe will need to be implemented. 


**Frequency Results** using different lexicons (*explict*, *neutral*, *implicit*) can be visualized [here](https://github.com/defoe-code/defoe_visualization/tree/master/Round_1/Janell_Kwork).
