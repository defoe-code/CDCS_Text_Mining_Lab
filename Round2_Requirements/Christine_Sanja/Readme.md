**Identifying Peace Agreements during 1785 -2014**


Use defoe to look at the entire archive and identify how the terms ‘ceasefire’, ‘peace agreements’ or ‘peace settlement’ appear in text over the entire 1785-2014 period. This would include things like:
- Frequency over time
- Most commonly used adjacent words
- Creating a corpus of only those articles that use the relevant terms, and then running topic models on them
- Using the results of the topic models to compare to historical conflict data or historical political data (like the historical V-Dem, which goes back to about the same time, in the late 1700s).
- Running a geoparser to identify locations which are mentioned in relation to peace
