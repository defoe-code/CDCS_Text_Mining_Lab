## Project Description

**Exploring the use of Scots in printed texts produced in Scotland during the 18th-19th centuries**

Create a new defoe query to create a lexicon with the  “uniquely Scots” words within the DSL collection by using several scots dictionaries and a high-frequency words list. 

The output of this first query (uniquely scots lexicon) will be used to run a second search of those terms to discover whether the Scots words and constructions could also be found in later printed texts or not. 

The project is very clear and well written. Some adaptations in the current defoe queries will be needed to support those dictionaries.
