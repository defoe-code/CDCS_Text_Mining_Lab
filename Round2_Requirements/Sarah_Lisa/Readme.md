**Exploring the use of Scots in printed texts produced in Scotland during the 18th-19th centuries**

Since the 16th century, Scots has been increasingly influenced by English, and particularly in writing; written Scots came to be seen as less appropriate and less lucrative for text genres such as newspapers. On the basis of this, we are interested in exploring the use of written Scots in these broadsides chapbooks, with the following questions in mind: 

- Does Scots survive in the printed world?
- If so, what kind of Scots survives? Do we see use of specialised terminology in the religious, legal and educational fields, or the use of idiomatic expressions and phrases, or more subtle use through syntactical and semantic Scots features? 
- Do we find evidence of hybridisation or the spelling variability which characterised Older written Scots? 
- In what contexts is Scots used and how do these indicate the status it had as a written medium during this time?.
